# About our DNS Tool

We offer a reliable, redundant DNS hosting solution within the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/network/dns/list) that gives you a central location for viewing and managing domains. You could manage your domains in other ways; however, DNS management with {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} alleviates the need to go to another website or open an additional tool. Our highly redundant environment enables you to interact with all aspects of your DNS. Our DNS management tool is free to all customers. It covers primary, secondary, and reverse DNS management.
