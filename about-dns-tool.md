# About our Domain Name Registration tool
{:#about-our-dns-tool}

We offer a reliable, redundant DNS hosting solution within the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} console](https://{DomainName}/classic/network/dns/list) that gives you a central location for viewing and managing domains. You could manage your domains in other ways; however, Domain Name Registration management with {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} alleviates the need to go to another website or open an additional tool. Our highly redundant environment enables you to interact with all aspects of your DNS. Our Domain Name Registration management tool is free to all customers. It covers primary, secondary, and reverse DNS management.
