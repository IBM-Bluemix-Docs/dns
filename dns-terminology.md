# DNS Terminology

## Caching and time to live

Because of the huge volume of requests generated by a system like the DNS, the designers provided a mechanism to reduce the load on individual DNS servers, as follows:

When a DNS resolver (that is, a client) receives a DNS response, it caches that response for a given period of time, called the time to live, or TTL. The value of TTL is set by the administrator of the DNS server handing out the response. Once a response goes into cache, the resolver consults its cached (stored) answer; only when the TTL expires (or when an administrator manually flushes the response from the resolver's memory) will the resolver contact the DNS server for the same information.

## Start of Authority (SOA) record parameters

Generally, the time to live is specified in the Start of Authority (SOA) record. SOA parameters are:

### Serial

The revision number of this zone file. Increment this number each time the zone file is changed so that the changes will be distributed to any secondary DNS servers.

### Refresh

The amount of time in seconds that a secondary name server should wait to check for a new copy of a DNS zone from the domain's primary name server. If a zone file has changed then the secondary DNS server will update it's copy of the zone to match the primary DNS server's zone.

### Retry

The amount of time in seconds that a domain's primary name server (or servers) should wait if an attempt to refresh by a secondary name server failed before attempting to refresh a domain's zone with that secondary name server again.

### Expire

The amount of time in seconds that a secondary name server (or servers) will hold a zone before it is no longer considered authoritative.

### Minimum

The amount of time in seconds that a domain's resource records are valid. This is also known as a minimum TTL, and can be overridden by an individual resource record's TTL.

### TTL (time to live)

The number of seconds a domain name is cached locally before expiration and return to authoritative nameservers for updated information.
