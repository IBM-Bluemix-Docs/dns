# Register Multiple New Domains

Multiple domains may be registered simultaneously, on a single screen, if there is an active credit card linked to your account or an available credit on your account. Follow the steps in this article to register multiple new domains at one time.

* Navigate to the **Domain Registration** screen on the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/). Refer to [Using the Domain Registration Screen](use-domain-reg-screen.html){:new_window}.
* Choose the **Register** tab.
* Select the **Register Multiple Domains?** option within the **Register** tab.
* Enter the new domain name in the **Domain Name** field.
* Select the domain type from the **Domain** drop down list.
* Select the amount of time to reserve the domain from the **Registration Time** drop down list.

    * **Note:** The price for each time period is displayed next to the amount of time and will be charged to the credit card or deducted from the credit on the account at the point the new domains are registered.

* Repeat **Steps 3-6** for each additional domain requiring registration.

    * **Note:** Select the **Add Another** option to populate additional blank fields for more domain entries. Click the **Delete** icon to delete an entire entry from the screen.

* Choose the **Check Availability** button to determine if the desired domains are available.<br><br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>If...</th><th>Then...</th></tr><tr><td>All desired domains are available</td><td>Proceed to the next step.</td></tr><tr><td>One or more domains are not available</td><td>Return to <strong>Step 4</strong> and amend each domain that is unavailable to check the availability of alternate domains</td></tr></tbody></table>
* Select the **Continue** button to register the domains.

## What Happens Next

After successfully registering the domains, they are reserved for the amount of time selected. They may be managed using the Customer Portal. When the registration period for the domains expires, they may be [renewed](renew-multiple-existing-domains.html) through the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/)
