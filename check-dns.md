# Check a Domain's Propagation Status

The **Check DNS** tool on the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/) lets you check the most recent time entries have propagated to DNS servers, and the standard propagation time for the selected domain and its authoritative name servers.  Follow the steps below to check a domainâ€™s DNS propagation status on the console:

1. Enter the domain in the **Domain** text box(es).
2. Click the **Check DNS** button.  Your results will appear on the right side of the screen.
