# Edit a DNS Zone Record

Existing DNS Zone Records may be edited by a user to update various areas, such as Time to Live (TTL), Pointer (PTR) records and Host Names. Multiple hosts and aliases may be associated with a DNS Zone Record at any given time. Follow the steps below to edit an existing DNS Zone Record.

* Navigate to the desired **DNS Zone** screen. Refer to [Using the DNS Zones Screen](use-dns-zones-screen.html).
* Click on the **row** containing any existing record. **Note:** Records that are italicized are not open to edit. This is generally limited to NS (or name server) records.
* Update the details of the record as necessary.
* Select the **Update** button to update the record, or select **Cancel** to cancel the action.

## What Happens Next

Upon updating the record, its details will automatically display the new entry. Records may be updated at any time, existing records may be deleted, and new records may be [added](add-dns-zone-record.html).
