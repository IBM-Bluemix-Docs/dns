# About Domains
{:#about-domains}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} offers domain management for all customers, by using the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/). There is no need to register, renew, and manage your domain(s) with a third party. Our customers can obtain a domain, renew, and transfer a domain, and they can manage their domain(s) immediately, using the same tools.
