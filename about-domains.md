# About Domains

IBM Cloud offers domain management for all customers, by using the Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/). There is no need to register, renew, and manage your domain(s) with a third party. Our customers can obtain a domain, renew, and transfer a domain, and they can manage their domain(s) immediately, using the same tools.
