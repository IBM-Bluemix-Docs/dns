# Delete a DNS Zone

After a DNS Zone has been added, it may be deleted at any time. DNS Zone deletions are permanent; they cannot be undone. Follow these steps to delete a DNS Zone:

* Navigate to the desired **DNS Zone** screen. Refer to [Using the DNS Zones Screen](use-dns-zones-screen.html){:new_window}.
* Select the **Delete** icon at then end of the row containing the desired DNS Zone. A pop-up confirmation box will appear.
* Select the **Yes** button to confirm the deletion, or select the **No** button to cancel the action.

## What Happens Next

After deleting a DNS Zone, it may no longer be managed using the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/). To manage the deleted zone in the Portal again, it must be [added as a new Zone](add-dns-zone.html).
