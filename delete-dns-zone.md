# Delete a DNS Zone
{:#delete-a-dns-zone}

After a DNS Zone has been added, it may be deleted at any time. DNS Zone deletions are permanent; they cannot be undone. Follow these steps to delete a DNS Zone:

* Navigate to the desired **DNS Zone** screen by selecting **Classic Infrastructure** from the navigation menu. 
* Select **Network > DNS** from the Classic Infrastructure navigation menu and choosing the type of zone you need.
* Select the **Delete** icon at then end of the row containing the desired DNS Zone. A pop-up confirmation box will appear.
* Select the **Yes** button to confirm the deletion, or select the **No** button to cancel the action.

## What Happens Next
{:#delete-a-dns-zone-next}

After deleting a DNS Zone, it may no longer be managed using the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/). To manage the deleted zone in the Portal again, it must be [added as a new Zone](/docs/infrastructure/dns?topic=dns-add-a-dns-zone).
