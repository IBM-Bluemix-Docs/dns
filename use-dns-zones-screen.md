# Use the DNS Zones Screens

Before you interact with the DNS service, navigate to the appropriate DNS screen in the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/){:new_window}.

Follow the procedures given to reach each screen for an account's DNS Zones.
