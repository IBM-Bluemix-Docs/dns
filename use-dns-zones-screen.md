# Use the DNS Zones Screen (main DNS screen)

 The primary DNS screen is the DNS Zones screen, which displays all DNS zones available on the account. Therefore, before you interact with the DNS service, navigate to the DNS screen in the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}. To filter what is displayed associated with the DNS service, you can view the Foward Zones, Secondary Zones or Reverse Records screens. Follow the procedures given to reach each screen for an account's DNS Zones.

1. Log in to the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.
* Select one of the following options from the **Network** dropdown menu based on the desired DNS view:<br/><br/><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>Desired View</th><th>Action</th></tr><tr><td>All DNS Zones</td><td>Select <strong>DNS</strong> from the <strong>Network</strong> dropdown menu.</td></tr><tr><td>Forward DNS Zones</td><td>Select <strong>Forward Zones</strong> from the <strong>DNS</strong> expansion within the <strong>Network</strong> dropdown menu.</td></tr><tr><td>Secondary DNS Zones</td><td>Select <strong>Secondary Zones</strong> from the <strong>DNS</strong> expansion within the <strong>Network</strong> dropdown menu.</td></tr><tr><td>Reverse DNS Records</td><td>Select <strong>Reverse Records</strong> from the <strong>DNS</strong> expansion within the <strong>Network</strong> dropdown menu.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## What Happens Next

Based on your selection, you can interact with individual DNS zones or reverse records. In the navbar to the left of your screen, you can see a full list of interactions.
