# Example DNS configurations for reference

The following images show some common DNS setups. Things to remember:

 * The `@` symbol is shorthand for the domain itself.
 * The `A Record` points from a `hostname` (such as `domain.com` or `sub.domain.com`) to an IP address (for example, 123.123.231.1).
 * The `CNAME Record` points from a `hostname` (such as `domain.com` or `sub.domain.com`) to another `hostname`.
