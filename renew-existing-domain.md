# Renew an Existing Domain

When a new domain is registered, it is reserved for use by the registrant for a pre-determined amount of time that is chosen at the time the domain is registered. When that time period expires, the domain becomes inactive and available for purchase by any person or entity. To keep a registered domain active, it must be renewed prior to the date it is set to expire. Domains may be renewed if there is an active credit card linked to your account, or an available credit on your account. Follow the steps in this article to renew your registration for an existing domain.

* Navigate to the **Domain Registration** screen on the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/). Refer to [Using the Domain Registration Screen](use-domain-reg-screen.html).
* Choose the **Renew** tab.
* Select the name of the domain requiring renewal from the **Domain** drop down list.
* Select the amount of time for which to renew the domain from the **Registration Time** drop down list.

  * **Note:** The price for each time period is displayed next to the amount of time and will be charged to the credit card or deducted from the credit on the account when the domain is renewed.

* Select the **Continue** button to renew the domain.

## What Happens Next

Upon renewal of the domain, it is reserved for the amount of time selected. Repeat these steps when the domain requires renewal.
