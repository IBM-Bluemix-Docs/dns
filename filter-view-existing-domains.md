# Filter the View of Existing Domains

A list of all active domains associated with the account is displayed on the **Domains** screen. For accounts with multiple domains, the view may be filtered to view and interact with selected domains. Follow the steps below to filter the view of existing domains.

1. From your browser, open the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} and log into your account.
2. In the Customer Portal navigation, select **Services > Domain Registration** and select the **Filter** tab.
3. Determine whether domains should be filtered by Domain Name, Expiration Date, or Lock Status:<br/><br/><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>If filtering by...</th><th>Then...</th></tr><tr><td>Domain Name</td><td>Enter all or part of the domain name in the <strong>Domain Name</strong> field or select the domain name from the dropdown list.</td></tr><tr><td>Expiration Date</td><td>Select the period of time when the domain will expire from the <strong>Expires</strong> dropdown list.</td></tr><tr><td>Lock Status</td><td>Select the applicable lock status from the <strong>Lock Status</strong> dropdown list.</td></tr></tbody></table>

4. Choose the **Filter** button to filter the domains listed, or select **Cancel** to cancel the filter options.

## What Happens Next

After filtering, all domains that meet the requirements set by the filters are displayed. You may change the filters that have been applied to the domains displayed, just by selecting the **Modify** button and repeating the steps above. To clear all filters, use the **Clear All** button.
