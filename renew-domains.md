# Renew Existing Domains
{:#renew-an-existing-domain}

When a new domain is registered, it is reserved for use by the registrant for a pre-determined amount of time that is chosen at the time the domain is registered. When that time period expires, the domain becomes inactive and available for purchase by any person or entity. To keep a registered domain active, it must be renewed prior to the date it is set to expire. Domains may be renewed if there is an active credit card linked to your account, or an available credit on your account. They may be renewed one at a time, or multiple domains at one time. Follow the steps in this article to renew your registration for existing domains.

## Renew a single domain
{: #renew-single-domain}

* Navigate to the **Domain Registration** screen on the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/). Refer to [Using the Domain Registration Screen](/docs/infrastructure/dns?topic=dns-how-to-use-the-domain-registration-screen).
* Choose the **Renew** tab.
* Select or type in the name of the domain requiring renewal from the **Renew Domain** drop down list.
* Click **Continue**.
* Select the amount of time for which to renew the domain from the **Registration Time** drop down list.

The price for each time period is displayed next to the amount of time and will be charged to the credit card or deducted from the credit on the account when the domain is renewed.

## Renew multiple domains
{: renew-multiple-domains}

* Navigate to the **Domain Registration** screen on the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Console ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/). Refer to [Using the Domain Registration Screen](/docs/infrastructure/dns?topic=dns-how-to-use-the-domain-registration-screen).
* Choose the **Renew** tab.
* Click the **Renew multiple domains?** link.
* In the window that appears, select or type in the name of the domain requiring renewal from the **Multiple Domain Renewal** drop down list.
  * There are two fields by default. If you need to renew more than two domains, click **Add Another** to create as many entries as needed.
  * Click the **Remove** icon at the end of any entry to delete that domain from the renewal selection.
* Select the amount of time for which to renew each domain from the **Registration Time** drop down list. This option only appears after a domain is selected.
* Click **Continue** to renew the domains, or click **Cancel** to end the action.
