# Search for a Secondary DNS Zone

After a Secondary DNS Zone is added, users may search for the Zone using the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/). This tool is useful when looking to locate a single Zone among a large number of Secondary Zones. Follow these steps to search for a Secondary DNS Zone.

* Navigate to the **Secondary DNS Zones** screen in the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://{DomainName}/). Refer to [Using the DNS Zones Screen](/docs/infrastructure/dns?topic=dns-use-the-dns-zones-screens){:new_window}.
* Select the **Filter** tab.
* Enter the zone name in the **Zone** field, or select it from the drop down list.
* Choose the **Filter** button to filter the results to the desired zone, or select **Cancel** to cancel the action.

## What Happens Next

The search results for the Secondary DNS Zone are displayed below the **Filter** tab. The Secondary Zone may be [edited](/docs/infrastructure/dns?topic=dns-edit-a-secondary-dns-zone) or [deleted](/docs/infrastructure/dns?topic=dns-delete-a-secondary-dns-zone) at any time.
