# About DNS

The internet's Domain Name System (DNS) is an worldwide method of translating IP addresses that servers and routers recognize into user-friendly, given names (such as ibm.com). While the concept of DNS is simple, managing and storing records for your various domains can become quite tedious if there isnâ€™t a convenient method to do so. {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} DNS offers customers a central location from which to view and manage their domains through our basic DNS management interface. It also gives users the option to manage reverse and secondary DNS in the same location, free of charge.

For specific instructions about using our DNS interface through the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/), [please see this document.](https://github.ibm.com/Bluemix-Docs/dns/blob/staging/using-the-dns-interface.md)
